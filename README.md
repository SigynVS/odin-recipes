# Odin Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project’s Foundations course.  
The goal is to build a basic recipe website using only HTML.  

By completing this project, I will demonstrate that I can:
- Set up and work inside a Git repository
- Use command-line Git commands to track and commit my work
- Create and organize files and folders for a web project
- Structure a webpage using HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images

This project will serve as a foundation before moving into more advanced HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts.
